# WebSocket Server

The PHP WebSocket Server package is a library built on top of [ReactPHP](https://reactphp.org/) to run a [WAMP version 1](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419051041/http://wamp.ws/spec/wamp1/) compliant WebSocket server.

This package is based heavily on the design of [Ratchet](https://github.com/ratchetphp/Ratchet) with opinionated re-implementations of its core architecture.
